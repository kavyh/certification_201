        "description": "<div></div><div>Three years ago today I launched Start Bootstrap, and ever since it’s  been my mission to provide the web design community with quality, open source templates and themes. First off, I’d like to thank all of the visitors, users, and contributors that have passed through in the last few years because without you Start Bootstrap would be nothing like it is today!<br/><p>Along with a shiny new design update to Start Bootstrap, I wanted to share with you some of the improvements and new content that will be coming in the next few months!</p><br/><h3 id=\"design-guides-and-code-tutorials-are-coming\">Design Guides and Code Tutorials are Coming!</h3><br/><p>In the past, support for the content on Start Bootstrap has been limited to code comments, Disqus discussions, email requests, and GitHub issues - until now! I’m proud to announce that Start Bootstrap will begin publishing code tutorials to help educate designers and developers who are newer to Bootstrap or need help working with templates and themes. I’ll also be releasing design guides which will offer techniques and inspiration for those who are looking to create Bootstrap websites with a unique look and feel!</p><br/><p>I’ll be elaborating a bit more on the structure of these new resources in a follow up post soon!</p><br/><h3 id=\"new-themes\">New Themes</h3><br/><p>In addition to the guides and tutorials, there will also be some shiny new themes coming to Start Bootstrap! I’ve been listening to your <br/>suggestions on Twitter and via email, and I’ll be creating versions of some frequently requested templates.</p><br/><p>Alongside these new themes, current themes on Start Bootstrap will be updated as needed, which already started with Gulp and npm support on some of the more popular themes.</p><br/><h3 id=\"preparing-for-bootstrap-4\">Preparing for Bootstrap 4</h3><br/><p>Finally, Start Bootstrap is preparing for the impending release of Bootstrap 4. All templates and themes on Start Bootstrap will be updated<br/> to Bootstrap 4 once the new version is released, and don’t worry the Bootstrap 3 versions will still be available via GitHub!</p><br/><p>I hope you like the new design to the site, and make sure to keep an eye on Start Bootstrap in the coming months for some new themes along with tutorials and guides! The best way to stay informed is to follow Start Bootstrap on Twitter, or to subscribe to our mailing list and I’ll send you updates when new content is available.</p><br/><p>Until next time, happy coding!</p><br/></div><!--EndFragment--><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>",

        "title": "One Year of Start Bootstrap!",
        "category": "News",
        "description": "<p>Hello Start Bootstrap users! It’s been a whole year since StartBootstrap has launched, and it’s been a great one thanks to you. Over the course of the year, Start Bootstrap has become one of the most popular Bootstrap related websites on the web!</p><div><br/><p>In the past year, Start Bootstrap has seen 1.3 Million unique users visit the site. These users accounted for 2.2 Million visits and 7.5 Million page views. That being said, it’s been an awesome year overall as far as the statistics are concerned.</p><br/><h3 id=\"start-bootstrap-20\">Start Bootstrap 2.0!</h3><br/><p>With the one year anniversary of Start Bootstrap, I would also like to make everybody aware of the launch of Start Bootstrap 2.0! If you haven’t noticed by now, Start Bootstrap has been completely redesigned! The new design is nice, but more importantly, we’re now hosted on GitHub Pages, and we are using Jekyll to post new content. What this means is that when I have an idea for a new template, I’ll be able to add it to Start Bootstrap much faster, and updating the site will be much more efficient. Overall, I’m hoping that the new update will result in the <br/>more frequent addition of new templates.</p><br/><h3 id=\"bower-packages\">Bower Packages</h3><br/><p>As we move into the future, there are a few things that I will be adding to Start Bootstrap. The first thing that I’ll be working on is creating Bower packages for all of the themes on Start Bootstrap. I am really aiming for Start Bootstrap to be a bit more developer friendly, and while manually installing the downloaded template files is easy enough, Bower will cater to the developers a bit better.</p><br/><p>Over the next few months (as time permits) I will be segmenting all of the templates on Start Bootstrap into their own GitHub repo (finally) and creating Bower packages for each template. For everyone else out there, don’t worry, the .zip files that you download from the site will still be there for manual installation!</p><br/><h3 id=\"wordpress-and-more\">WordPress and More</h3><br/><p>After getting the Bower packages all set, I’ll be looking at creating WordPress and other CMS versions of some of the more popular templates on Start Bootstrap. I have had loads of requests asking for WordPress versions of a few templates, and it’s about time to start delivering on some of those. I have a few contributors who may be helping to convert some of the themes over to various CMS’ and I will be tackling some of them on my own.<br/></p><br/><p>Currently, I am looking at using Roots in order to create the WordPress versions of some of the themes since it’s a Bootstrap based <br/>WordPress framework.</p><br/><h3 id=\"special-thanks\">Special Thanks</h3><br/><p>That about covers all of the updates for now. I’m excited to keep improving Start Bootstrap. Lastly, I wanted to thank all of the people who shared Start Bootstrap with their friends and coworkers throughout the past year. Without you, Start Bootstrap wouldn’t be what it is today! I’ll keep an eye out for everyone on Twitter, and if you haven’t followed Start Bootstrap yet then you can follow the project at @SBootstrap. Also, if you want to follow me (the creator of Start Bootstrap) then you can follow me at @davidmillerskt.</p><br/><p>Until next time, I hope your projects are a success, and Start Bootstrap will be here when you need it!</p><p><br/></p></div>",

Most notably, the menu bar in version 2 is greatly improved. On mobile devices, the side bar collapses into a nice, three-level dropdown that sits under the user interface links that behave as normal (and slightly modified) dropdowns.</p><br/><p>Among other improvements, we’ve updated the morris.js plugin to feature fully responsive morris charts, and Tablesorter was dropped in favor of dataTables, which is customized to work with Bootstrap 3 and Font Awesome icons.</p><br/><p>We also want to give a special thanks to Bootsnipp for providing us with some awesome code snippets that were worked in which include: a timeline, chat widget, login page, circle buttons, outline buttons, and social buttons.
